# Rock-Paper-Scissors
My project as Rock-Paper-Scissors game
This program is a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game:

User enters their name and chooses "ROCK", "PAPER", or "SCISSORS."
Computer picks randomly from rock, paper, or scissors.
The game compares the choices:
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.
The game keeps track of wins for both the player and the computer.
The first to win 3 rounds is declared the winner.
After someone wins, the player can choose to play again or end the game.
